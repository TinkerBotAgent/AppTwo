 Critical Issues to Address
1. HIPAA Compliance (Major Concern)
Since this handles health data, you need:
Data encryption (AES-256)
Secure authentication (2FA, OAuth)
Audit logging for all data access
User consent management
Data anonymization options
Secure backup procedures
Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)
// Missing input validation
- Food analysis result validation
- User input sanitization
// Missing error boundaries
- Global error handling
- API error management
- User-friendly er
// Missing centralized state
- User session management
- Food analysis cache
- Recipe favorites
- Meal plan persistence
- Settings synchronization
- Offline data handling
üîß Recommended Next Steps
Immediate (Critical):
Set up proper routing with React Router
Implement authentication with secure session management
Add input validation for all user inputs
Create error boundaries for graceful error handling
Set up API layer with proper error handling
Short Term (Important):
HIPAA compliance implementation
Data encryption for sensitive health data
State management (Redux Toolkit or Zustand)
Testing framework setup
Performance optimization
Medium Term (Enhancement):
Offline support with service workers
Push notifications for reminders
Social features (sharing, community)
Advanced analytics dashboard
Mobile app (React Native)

}
// Centralized API service

  // ... other methods
